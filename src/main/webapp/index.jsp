            <h4>Hi there</h4>
            <b>Welcome on Board!</b> This is our Project Work. We're doing a Software Developer Course at
            the Wifi Wien and are now on our way straight foreward to the examination. This application
            you are standing in front of is a very important part of this survey.<br>
            Once you registered yourself you are a normal user who can create, update and delete
            your own blog-postings. You can connect other users you are special interested in. At this time
            you get the posts of your connected users in a particular view. Click on connected at the
            navigation-bar.<br>
            But before becoming a motormouth, register, login, create a post, connect and disconnect
            other users, shortly: play around a little.
